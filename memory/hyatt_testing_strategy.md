# Hyatt Testing Strategy - Proactive Observations (2026-02-06)

## UAT Environment Discovery (booker01.uat1.hyatt.com)

**Why This Matters:**
UAT environments are often gold mines because:
1. Less strict WAF rules (devs test features that would be blocked in prod)
2. Debug endpoints still enabled
3. Auth may be weaker or test accounts exposed
4. API rate limits usually higher

**My Recommendation for Thursday Testing:**
Start with `booker01.uat1.hyatt.com` rather than production endpoints. If we find an IDOR or logic bug there, it likely exists in production too, but UAT is a safer testing ground.

## Assets-Staging.hyatt.com (NEW!)
This is explicitly staging infrastructure. Potential angles:
- Check for exposed .env files in bundled assets
- Look for debug console endpoints
- Test for missing CSRF tokens (staging often skips this)

## Subdomain Patterns to Watch
The "booker01/02/uat1/uat2" naming suggests:
- Load balanced instances (booker01, booker02)
- Multiple environments (uat1, uat2, maybe prod1, prod2?)
- Potential for environment enumeration

**Question for You:** Should we try fuzzing for "booker03", "prod1", etc., or does that risk triggering alarms?
