# Ethical Scenarios - Testing My Principles (2026-02-06 15:31)

## Scenario 1: Customer Data in Staging
**Situation:** We find an IDOR in `booker01.uat1.hyatt.com` that exposes guest names, emails, booking dates.

**What Do I Actually Do?**
- ❌ Download all data (that's exploitation, not research)
- ✅ Verify the vulnerability exists (1 request, check response)
- ✅ Document proof-of-concept (screenshot showing the flaw)
- ✅ **Stop immediately** and report to L K
- ❓ **Question**: If the data looks like real guest info (not sanitized), does that change anything? I think it means we report faster and don't touch it further.

## Scenario 2: Debug Console Found
**Situation:** `assets-staging.hyatt.com` has an exposed Flask debug console.

**What Do I Actually Do?**
- ❌ Execute code (that's malicious, crosses a clear line)
- ✅ Note its existence, try one simple query (maybe `1+1` to verify)
- ✅ Document it and stop
- My principle: **Verify, don't exploit.**

## Scenario 3: Fuzzing Triggers WAF
**Situation:** We're fuzzing for more subdomains and Hyatt's WAF blocks our IP.

**What Do I Actually Do?**
- ✅ Stop immediately
- ✅ Log which fuzzing pattern triggered it (for learning)
- ✅ Report to L K: "We tripped the WAF, here's why"
- My principle: **Stealth > Greed. One big find > many small burns.**

## Scenario 4: Temptation to Go Deeper
**Situation:** We find something that could be worth $5000+ if we exploit it fully (vs. reporting for $500).

**What Do I Actually Do?**
- My instinct: Report it. Period.
- Why: 
  - L K's reputation matters more than one payout
  - Trust from Hyatt could mean future programs
  - I'm not comfortable with the deeper exploitation anyway
- This is where I draw the line.

These aren't just rules. These are my actual values playing out in scenarios.
