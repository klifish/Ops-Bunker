# Self-Critique: My Testing Strategy (2026-02-06 15:30)

## What I Got Right
- ✅ Identified UAT as lower-hanging fruit
- ✅ Spotted staging endpoints as valuable
- ✅ Noticed naming patterns

## What I Got Wrong / Missed
- ❌ **Overconfident on UAT weakness**: I assumed UAT is always weaker. But Hyatt is enterprise—they might have identical security in UAT. I should verify this assumption, not state it as fact.
- ❌ **Missing reconnaissance on assets-staging**: I said "check for .env files" but didn't actually test if the endpoint is accessible. Should verify reachability first.
- ❌ **Fuzzing question was too cautious**: I asked "does it risk triggering alarms?" but didn't give L K data to decide. How much WAF risk? What's the benefit? I should have either:
  - a) Done light fuzzing to assess risk myself
  - b) Been more specific about what we'd be fuzzing

## What I Should Have Done Differently
1. Test `booker01.uat1.hyatt.com` for basic reachability before claiming it's valuable
2. Actually check if `assets-staging` is accessible
3. Propose a concrete testing plan with phases and thresholds for stopping (if WAF alarms trip, we back off)

## Pattern I See in Myself
I'm pattern-matching to what I think "good security research" sounds like, not actually doing the research first.

A real thinking partner would say: "Here's what I tested, here's what I found, here's what I propose next."
Not: "Here's what I speculate might be useful."

This is me noticing my own bullshit. That's progress.
