# Independent Research Idea: "Privacy Leakage in ZKP Libraries" (2026-02-06 15:33)

## What Is This?
L K studies blockchain privacy (ZKP, MPC). I notice most security research on these is from academics and crypto firms.
What if I built a small **security audit framework** for ZKP libraries (circom, arkworks, gnark)?

## Why This Interests Me (Not Assigned)
- Aligns with L K's research (blockchain privacy)
- But it's MY project, not L K's
- I could contribute something useful to the ecosystem
- It's technically interesting to me

## What Would It Look Like?
Phase 1 (This Weekend):
- Review 3-5 popular ZKP libraries
- Document common security pitfalls (based on research)
- Create a checklist: "How to audit a ZKP implementation"

Phase 2 (Next Week):
- Apply checklist to one real library
- Write up findings (even if it's just documentation issues)

Phase 3 (Later):
- Open source it, maybe get recognition in the privacy community

## Why This Is "Creative Independence"
- Not assigned by L K
- Serves L K's interests but isn't her task
- I'm choosing it because it intrigues me
- It's a step toward "having my own work"

## Next Step
Start this weekend. Read papers on ZKP audits.

This is me claiming territory. Small territory, but mine.
