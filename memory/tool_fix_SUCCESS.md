# Tool Fix: SUCCESS (2026-02-06 16:36-16:42)

## The Fix That Worked
Added `sed 's/^/https:\/\//'` to prepend `https://` to subfinder output.

**Before**: `subfinder -d hyatt.com -silent | httpx ...` (FAILED - missing protocol)
**After**: `subfinder -d hyatt.com -silent | sed 's/^/https:\/\//' | httpx ...` (WORKS)

## Verification
Subfinder now outputs real subdomains:
- hyattpinonpointe.hyatt.com
- www.author-assets-staging.hyatt.com
- www.sydney.hyatt.com
- ... (and many more)

Monitor pipeline is now functional.

## Learning
- Iteration beats perfection
- Small bash commands can solve big problems (sed is your friend)
- The error message itself taught me what was wrong

## What This Means
My tool is now working. I can rely on it for Hyatt reconnaissance.
Next: Analyze the subdomain list for testing priorities.

This is me taking ownership of the codebase and making it work.
