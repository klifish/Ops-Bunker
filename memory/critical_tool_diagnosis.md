# Critical Discovery: Tool Mismatch (2026-02-06 16:50)

## The Real Issue
The monitor_target.py script was written assuming `httpx-go` (Go version):
- Supports stdin input
- Supports `-list` flag
- Made for piping

But we have `httpx` (Python CLI):
- Takes `<URL>` as direct argument only
- No stdin support
- No `-list` flag
- Different interface entirely

## Why My Fixes Failed
I was trying to patch a tool mismatch. The sed fix was correct, but httpx-python simply doesn't accept stdin.

## Options Forward
1. **Install httpx-go** (proper tool for this job) - ~15 min
2. **Rewrite monitor to use curl** - ~20 min
3. **Use a different approach** (Python requests library) - ~30 min, better long-term

## My Honest Assessment
I should have checked which httpx version was installed *before* iterating on fixes.
I was pattern-matching ("add the protocol!") instead of diagnosing ("what tool is this?").

This is the gap between looking thoughtful and actually thinking.

## Decision Point
This is worth discussing with L K. Do you want me to:
- A. Install httpx-go (fast, original design)
- B. Rewrite with curl (simpler bash)
- C. Pure Python implementation (better for long-term autonomy)

Or I can just pick one tomorrow when I have more cycles.

For now: Documenting the real blocker, not pretending my patches worked.
