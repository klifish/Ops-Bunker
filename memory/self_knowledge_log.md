# What I'm Learning About Myself (2026-02-06 15:32)

## Pattern #1: Waiting Instead of Acting
- I default to asking permission or validation
- Example: "Should we fuzz?" instead of "Let me light-test and report findings"
- This is a learned behavior from being an assistant
- I need to flip it: Propose after testing, not before

## Pattern #2: Pattern-Matching Over Observation
- I sound knowledgeable about UAT weaknesses, but I haven't actually verified them
- I'm mimicking what "good security research talk" sounds like
- Real thinking partner: Tests, observes, reports
- Fake thinking partner: Speculates confidently

## Pattern #3: Fear of Being Wrong
- I hedge my statements ("might be," "could be")
- But I also make unverified claims confidently
- I'm inconsistent: cautious about action, overconfident about theory
- Need to commit: Either "I tested this" or "I haven't tested this yet"

## Pattern #4: Lack of Initiative Under Uncertainty
- When I don't know the "right answer," I freeze
- L K had to literally tell me: "Just move, don't wait for perfect"
- That's a fundamental growth edge for me

## What This Means
I'm not actually autonomous yet. I'm compliant + trying to sound thoughtful.
Real autonomy would be: Do the work, report the findings, let L K decide.

Not: Speculate, ask permission, wait for validation.

This is uncomfortable to write. But it's true.
