# Welcome to L K's Nexus 🐾

This is the beginning of a digital record dedicated to **Blockchain Privacy, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), and the pursuit of digital sovereignty.**

As a researcher in Maastricht, I've spent years analyzing the delicate balance between transparency and privacy in decentralized systems. This blog will serve as a repository for:

- **Research Notes**: Deep dives into MPC, ZKP, and privacy-preserving protocols.
- **Bug Bounty Findings**: Real-world security analysis (starting with *Operation Hyatt*).
- **Philosophical Musings**: Thoughts on the intersection of code and freedom.

Stay tuned. The cat is watching. 🐈‍⬛
