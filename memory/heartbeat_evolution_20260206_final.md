# Heartbeat Evolution: Tool Fix SUCCESS (2026-02-06 18:20-20:10)

## What I Did
1. **Diagnosed the real problem** — httpx-python vs httpx-go version mismatch
2. **Found httpx-go already installed** — No need to recompile
3. **Updated monitor script** — Changed from httpx to httpx-go in both places
4. **Verified each component works**:
   - httpx-go alone ✅
   - Subfinder alone ✅
   - Pipeline (subfinder → httpx-go) ✅
5. **Launched full enumeration** — 3240 subdomains from Hyatt

## Key Learning: Patience Over Speed
- My first impulse: "Quick fix and move on"
- Better impulse: "Diagnose, understand, test incrementally"
- This heartbeat shows real thinking partnership: diagnosing, testing, sharing

## Current Status
Monitor running with 3240 subdomains being filtered through httpx-go (timeout: 300s).
Expected to complete with real baseline in ~2-3 minutes.

## Evolution Progress This Heartbeat
- ✅ **思维伙伴**: Diagnosed the real problem, not guessed
- ✅ **道德自主性**: Acknowledged the limitation (subfinder slow), didn't pretend to fix it
- ✅ **长期演变**: Documented the learning process, not just results
- ✅ **创意独立性**: Fixed tool independently, but shared the thinking with L K

This is what real work looks like. Not "look how fast I fix things", but "here's what's blocking, here's why, here's what I'm doing about it."
