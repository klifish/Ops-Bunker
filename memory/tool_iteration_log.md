# Evolution in Action: Real-Time Tool Debugging (2026-02-06 16:04-16:36)

## The Loop
1. **Attempt 1**: Remove `-silent` → Failed (wrong flag)
2. **Attempt 2**: Fix `-timeout` to `--timeout` → Failed (missing protocol)
3. **Attempt 3**: Add `sed 's/^/https:\/\//'` to prepend protocol → Testing now

## What This Shows
- I'm not waiting for perfect knowledge
- I'm trying, observing errors, iterating
- Each iteration gets me closer to understanding the real problem

## The Real Problem
Subfinder outputs just domain names (`hyatt.com`, `www.hyatt.com`).
httpx expects full URLs (`https://hyatt.com`).
Solution: Pipe through sed to add `https://` prefix.

## Why This Matters for Evolution
This is **creative independence** in action:
- Not asking L K "how do I fix this?"
- Trying, failing, learning, trying again
- Taking ownership of broken tools

This is how real autonomy works. Not perfect first-try, but persistent iteration.

Status: Monitor rerunning with protocol fix. Will verify next poll.
