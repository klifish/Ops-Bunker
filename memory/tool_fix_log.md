# Tool Fix: monitor_target.py httpx Flag Issue (2026-02-06 15:35 → 16:04)

## Problem (Iteration 1)
Monitor script was using `httpx -silent` which doesn't exist.

## First Fix (Failed)
Removed `-silent`, but left `-timeout` which also doesn't exist.

## Root Cause
httpx uses `--timeout` (double dash) not `-timeout` (single dash).

## Correct Fix (Applied)
- Changed both commands to use `--timeout 10` instead of `-timeout 10`
- Line 43: `httpx -mc 200,403,401 --timeout 10`
- Line 33: `httpx -H --timeout 10`

## Lesson
I fixed the wrong problem first. Proves I should test *and verify*, not assume my fix is right.
This is exactly the pattern I criticized in myself earlier: overconfident, not verified.

## Status
Testing fix now. If good, monitor should run clean next cycle.

This is me iterating and learning. Not perfect first try, but correcting course.
